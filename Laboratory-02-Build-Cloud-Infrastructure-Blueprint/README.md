# Laboratory 02 - Build the Cloud Infrastructure Blueprint

## Mission Overview

This laboratory focused on investigating a Linux-based cloud environment and identifying the fundamental components of cloud infrastructure. The activity involved examining a cloud server, documenting its resources, researching major cloud providers, and designing a simple cloud infrastructure architecture.

## Objectives

The objectives of this laboratory were to:

- Investigate the configuration of a Linux cloud server.
- Identify compute, storage, networking, and operating system resources.
- Compare infrastructure services provided by AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
- Design a simple cloud infrastructure architecture.
- Practice technical documentation using Markdown and GitHub.

## Cloud Infrastructure Components

The main cloud infrastructure components identified during the laboratory were:

- *Compute:* The Linux environment uses an Intel Xeon E312xx processor with 1 CPU core.
- *Storage:* The environment has approximately 19 GB of disk capacity, with /dev/vda1 mounted as the main filesystem.
- *Networking:* The Linux environment has network connectivity and IP addresses including 172.30.1.2 and 172.17.0.1.
- *Operating System:* The environment runs Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS with kernel version 6.8.0-138-generic.

## Tools Used

The following tools were used during the laboratory:

- KillerCoda
- Linux Terminal
- GitHub
- Markdown
- Draw.io / diagrams.net
- Web browser
- Microsoft Word for viewing the laboratory instructions

## Linux Commands Executed

The following Linux commands were used to investigate the cloud server:

```bash
